# What is this?
- a Gui that simplifies the process of reading Multiwvn output files related to quantum chemical computations of electronic excitations in organic molecules

# How to run
- Check that the required modules are installed
- navigate to the `src` folder
- run `python index.py`
- input parameters in Gui
- pray
- look at your pretty graphs

# Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplots
- pyqt5

# To-Do:
- clean up plots
- add delete button to added states list
- add plotting function with interpolation between states (and interpolation selector)
- add state mixing capabilities
- include the multiwfn operation so I can just read .fchks

# To-Do - Larger Scope
- implement jablonski capabilities - with molecule selector
